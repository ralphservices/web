My name is Ralph, I am...

 - CEO - Chief Eating Officer

And this is my by business.

---

I employ 2 Oomans (2 Paws) to do the woof work, Matt & Amanda.

Being a spaniel, i live life at full speed and quite often the things i need don't last evry long, harness', leads, etc so my Ooomans have spent a long time finding (and many monies), testing and approving my accessories.

Craft Pets @ Ralp Services aim's to bring you only Ralph-Approved hardware, tested at speed in mud and water.

We are NOT an online seller, we sell the products we believe in at Craft Markets & Pop-Up-Stalls.

You can find the events we are attending here:
