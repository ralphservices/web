## My Ooman's 

I employ 2 Oomans to do the woof work, Matt & Amanda.

Being a spaniel, I live life at full speed and quite often the things i need don't last very long, harness', leads, etc so my Ooomans have spent a long time finding (and many monies), testing and approving my accessories.

Craft Pets @ Ralp Services aim's to bring you only Ralph-Approved hardware, tested at speed in mud and water (and any other fun things I find to jump in)

We are NOT an online seller, we sell the products we believe in at Craft Markets & Pop-Up-Stalls.
